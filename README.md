# Project2
This file contains the HTML and CSS code for my OpenClassrooms Web Developer Path Project #2. 
The project involves creating a web page for Reservia and includes pictures of accommodations and activities. 
This is the initial coding project for this course.
My name Eric Rudy and I am preparing to present this project on Tuesday January 26.
